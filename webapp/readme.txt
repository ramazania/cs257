Explanations on images:

1. games.png: we are using Figma and we don't have experience with it so for this image we decided to use it from online source instead of making a diagram since it was hard for us. 
2. stats.png: we are interested in adding a page that has the top stats for each tournament and we didn't know how to make a diagram so we decided to use this image.
